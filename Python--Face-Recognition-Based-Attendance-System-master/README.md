# Python--Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
1.Introduction:
            The human face plays an important role in our social interaction, conveying peopleâ€™s identity. Using the human face as a key to security, biometric face recognition technology has received significant attention in the past several years due to its potential for a wide variety of applications in both law enforcement and non-law enforcement.   As compared with other biometrics systems using fingerprint/palmprint and iris, face recognition has distinct advantages because of its non-contact process. Face images can be captured from a distance without touching the person being identified, and the identification does not require interacting with the person. In addition, face recognition serves the crime deterrent purpose because face images that have been recorded and archived can later help identify a person. 

2.Recognition Process:
           Face Recognition Process is classified into three Phases as DataCreation Phase,Training Recognizer Phase,Detection Phase. 
2.1 DataSet Creation Phase 
           In this phase, pictures are captured and stored it in Dataset Folder. 
2.2 Training Recognizer Phase 
           In this Phase,the dataset is feed to LBPH Recogniser and trained the classifier. 
2.3 Detection Phase 
           In this Phase,the classifier is feed with new image and predicts the image either with known or unknown values. 
3. Updating Attendance  
           Finally the Image names and their attendance is marked in Excel sheet by camparing the current Id and Id in the sheet.
